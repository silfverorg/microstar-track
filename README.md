# Microstar Track Module

Module for handling all tracking and fetching.
Currently uses an internal database. This can and perhaps should moved later on.

This package should change name if it handles both tracking and fetching. (Originally only handled tracking).

## Install

```js
npm install
npm run build
```

## Test

```
npm test
```
